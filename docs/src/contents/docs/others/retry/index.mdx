# Auto Retry in Speedcast API

## Overview

Network failures and temporary server issues are inevitable in distributed systems. Speedcast API includes a robust automatic retry mechanism that intelligently handles transient errors, improving the reliability of your API calls without adding complexity to your code.

## How Auto Retry Works

When a request fails, Speedcast API:

1. Determines if the failure is retriable (e.g., network issues, server errors)
2. Waits using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server
3. Automatically retries the request up to the configured number of attempts
4. Returns the successful response if any retry succeeds
5. Propagates the error only after all retries have been exhausted

## Configuration

### Global Retry Configuration

You can configure retry behavior globally when creating your API instance:

```typescript
import { SpeedcastApi } from 'speedcast-api';

const api = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  retries: 3  // Retry failed requests up to 3 times (default)
});
```

### Per-Request Retry Configuration

You can also control retry behavior on a per-request basis:

```typescript
// Override global settings for this specific request
const response = await api.get('/critical-data', {
  retries: 5  // More retries for important data
});

// Disable retries for this specific request
const response = await api.get('/non-critical-data', {
  retries: 0  // No retries
});
```

## Exponential Backoff

Speedcast API uses exponential backoff to space out retry attempts, reducing server load and increasing the chance of success:

- First retry: 1 second delay
- Second retry: 2 seconds delay
- Third retry: 4 seconds delay
- Fourth retry: 8 seconds delay
- And so on...

This approach prevents overwhelming the server with too many requests in quick succession when it might be experiencing issues.

## Real-World Examples

### Handling Unreliable Networks

```typescript
// Mobile app scenario with unreliable connectivity
const mobileApi = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  retries: 3,  // Retry up to 3 times
  timeout: 10000  // 10 second timeout
});

// This function will automatically retry on network failures
async function syncUserData() {
  try {
    const response = await mobileApi.post('/sync', userData);
    console.log('Data synced successfully');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // This error is thrown only after all retries have failed
    console.error('Failed to sync data after multiple attempts');
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Critical Financial Operations

```typescript
// Banking API that requires high reliability
const bankingApi = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.banking.com',
  retries: 5  // More retries for critical financial operations
});

async function processPayment(paymentDetails) {
  try {
    const response = await bankingApi.post('/transactions', paymentDetails);
    return {
      success: true,
      transactionId: response.data.id
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Error logging after all retries failed
    console.error('Payment processing failed after multiple attempts:', error);
    return {
      success: false,
      reason: error.message
    };
  }
}
```

## Which Errors Trigger Retries

By default, Speedcast API will retry on the following conditions:

- Network errors (connection refused, DNS failures, etc.)
- HTTP 5xx server errors
- HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Request timeouts

However, it will NOT retry on:

- HTTP 4xx client errors (except 429)
- HTTP 3xx redirects (these are handled automatically)
- Canceled requests

This logic ensures that retries are only attempted when there's a reasonable chance of success on a subsequent attempt.

## Best Practices

### 1. Adjust Retry Count Based on Criticality

```typescript
// For critical operations
const criticalOps = await api.post('/payment', data, { retries: 5 });

// For non-critical operations
const nonCriticalOps = await api.get('/feed', { retries: 1 });
```

### 2. Combine with Timeout Settings

```typescript
// Set both timeouts and retries for optimal reliability
const response = await api.post('/process', data, {
  retries: 3,
  timeout: 5000  // 5 second timeout per attempt
});
```

### 3. Add Extra Error Handling for Critical Operations

```typescript
try {
  const response = await api.post('/critical-operation', data, {
    retries: 5
  });
  // Process success
} catch (error) {
  // This means all 5 retry attempts have failed
  // Implement fallback strategy or notify user
  console.error('Operation failed after multiple attempts:', error);
  notifyAdministrator(error);
}
```

### 4. Use with Idempotent Operations

Retries are safest with idempotent operations (GET, PUT, DELETE) where multiple identical requests produce the same result. For non-idempotent operations like POST, ensure your API can handle multiple identical requests correctly.

By leveraging Speedcast API's automatic retry functionality, you can build more resilient applications that gracefully handle temporary network issues and server errors.
