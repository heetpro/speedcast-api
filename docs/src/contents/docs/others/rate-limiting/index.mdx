# Rate Limiting in Speedcast API

## Overview

Rate limiting is an essential feature when working with APIs that have usage restrictions. Speedcast API includes built-in rate limiting functionality that automatically manages your request throughput to prevent hitting API limits.

## How Rate Limiting Works

When you configure rate limiting, Speedcast API:

1. Keeps track of the requests you've made in the specified time window
2. Automatically queues and delays requests when you approach your limit
3. Distributes requests evenly within the time window
4. Prevents API rate limit errors before they occur

## Configuration

### Global Rate Limiting

You can configure rate limiting when creating your API instance:

```typescript
import { SpeedcastApi } from 'speedcast-api';

const api = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
  rateLimit: {
    requests: 100,  // Maximum 100 requests
    window: 60000   // Per minute (60,000 milliseconds)
  }
});
```

## Real-World Examples

### Third-Party API Integration

```typescript
// GitHub API has a rate limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests
const githubApi = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.github.com',
  rateLimit: {
    requests: 60,
    window: 3600000  // 1 hour in milliseconds
  }
});

// Now you can make requests without worrying about rate limits
// Requests will be automatically throttled if needed
async function fetchAllRepositories(username: string) {
  try {
    const response = await githubApi.get(`/users/${username}/repos`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching repositories:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Aggressive Rate Limiting

For APIs with stricter limits:

```typescript
// For an API that only allows 5 requests per second
const strictApi = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.strict-service.com',
  rateLimit: {
    requests: 5,
    window: 1000  // 1 second
  }
});

// Even if you make multiple requests in rapid succession,
// they will be automatically spaced out to comply with the rate limit
async function processBatchOfItems(items: any[]) {
  const results = [];
  
  for (const item of items) {
    // These requests will be automatically throttled
    const response = await strictApi.post('/process', item);
    results.push(response.data);
  }
  
  return results;
}
```

## Benefits of Automatic Rate Limiting

1. **Prevent API Bans and Timeouts** - Avoid getting your IP or API key temporarily banned
2. **Optimize Request Distribution** - Spread requests evenly over time
3. **Remove Manual Timing Logic** - No need to manually implement delays between requests
4. **Maximize API Usage** - Use your full quota without exceeding limits
5. **Simplified Code** - No complex rate limiting logic in your application code

## Best Practices

- Set rate limits slightly below the actual API limits to account for other factors
- For critical applications, consider implementing additional fallback mechanisms
- Monitor API usage to adjust rate limits as needed
- Check API documentation for any changes to rate limits

## Advanced Usage

For advanced scenarios where you need dynamic rate limiting:

```typescript
// Create a rate-limited API instance
const dynamicApi = new SpeedcastApi({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
});

// Update rate limiting based on API response headers
function updateRateLimits(response: any) {
  const remainingRequests = parseInt(response.headers['x-rate-limit-remaining'] || '60');
  const resetTime = parseInt(response.headers['x-rate-limit-reset'] || '3600') * 1000;
  
  // Dynamically adjust rate limiting based on API response
  if (remainingRequests && resetTime) {
    dynamicApi.setRateLimit({
      requests: remainingRequests,
      window: resetTime
    });
  }
}
```

By leveraging Speedcast API's built-in rate limiting feature, you can confidently work with APIs without worrying about hitting rate limits or implementing complex throttling mechanisms yourself.
